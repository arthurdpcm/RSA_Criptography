RSA Encription method. There is four files in this repository:
- ## Encrypt.py
  #### This file uses Kivy to create the User Interface and it's where you are going to enter the public key generated by the decrypt.py and write the message to be encrypted.
- ## Decrypt.py
  #### This file uses Kivy to create the User Interface and it's where you are going to enter the key size (bits) to generate the public and private key, and also enter the encrypted message. 
- ## rsa_simulation.py
  #### This file run the process of encrypting and decrypting multiple times to compare how long takes to decrypt different sizes of key. It also plot the chart of it.
- ## hack_rsa_parallel.py
  #### This file tries to hack in a brute force the encrypted message. It runs from 5 bits to 15 bits running 10 times to have a best measure of how much time it takes. It also plot the chart of it. 

## Libraries necessary to run the following code:
- pip install kivy (encrypt.py and decrypt.py)
- pip install random
- pip install time
- pip install matplotlib.pyplot (hack_rsa_parallel.py, rsa_simulation.py)
- pip install multiprocessing
